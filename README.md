# system upgrades
* Add this into the configuration file if you have issues with Nvidia
```bash  
system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;
system.autoUpgrade.allowReboot = false;
boot.kernelPackages = pkgs.linuxPackages_6_5; # Use pkgs.linuxPackages_6_5 if nvidia drivers fail, use pkgs.linuxPackages_latest if nvidia drivers work on "latest"!
system.autoUpgrade.channel = "https://channels.nixos.org/nixos-23.11";
```

### 1. Clone
```bash
# Tolga Erok
# 14/7/2023
# Post Nixos setup!
# ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

cd $HOME
nix-env -iA nixos.git
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos-kde.git
cd nixos-kde
sudo cp /etc/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.bak
sudo rsync -av --exclude='.git' ./* /etc/nixos
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn) /etc/nixos
sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/nixos
sudo chmod +x /etc/nixos/*
export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1
```

### 2. Create symlink for this host or the machine you prefer
```bash
sudo ln -s nixos /etc/nixos
ln -s nixos/machines/HP-i7-EliteDesk-800-G1-SFF/EliteDesk-800-G1-configuration.nix
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
```

```bash
There’s no need to symlink - /etc/nixos/configuration.nix 
is just the default location, and you can change it. 
When you run nixos-rebuild, it looks up the value of “nixos-config” in the
NIX_PATH environment variable, so you can point that wherever you want. 
Example (as root):

export NIX_PATH="nixos-config=/path/to/configuration.nix"
nixos-rebuild switch
```

### nixpkgs
home-manager
```bash
# Clone repo into source dir
mkdir -p ~/s
cd ~/s
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos-kde.git
mkdir -p ~/.config
ln -s ~/s/nixos-kde/home-manager ~/.config/home-manager

nix-channel --add https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/archive/master.tar.gz home-manager
nix-channel --update

nix-shell '<home-manager>' -A install
```

## *`Enhancing User Experience through Kernel Optimization`*
In the pursuit of an even smoother computing journey, I've delved into the realm of kernel optimization. By fine-tuning how data flows from memory to disk, we can wield significant influence over the performance and responsiveness of our systems. These adjustments aren't just about technical tweaks; they're about crafting an environment that elevates our user experience.

Imagine having the ability to optimize memory usage, fine-tune disk writeback behavior, and even tailor network settings. These kernel tweaks transcend the mundane, offering a deeper level of control over the low-level aspects of our system's behavior. Through this journey of exploration and customization, we're not just configuring a machine; we're sculpting an environment that responds to our needs and aspirations.

```nix
{
  boot.kernel.sysctl = {
    "kernel.sysrq" = 1;                       # SysRQ for is rebooting their machine properly if it freezes: SOURCE: https://oglo.dev/tutorials/sysrq/index.html
    "net.core.rmem_default" = 16777216;       # Default socket receive buffer size, improve network performance & applications that use sockets
    "net.core.rmem_max" = 16777216;           # Maximum socket receive buffer size, determin the amount of data that can be buffered in memory for network operations
    "net.core.wmem_default" = 16777216;       # Default socket send buffer size, improve network performance & applications that use sockets
    "net.core.wmem_max" = 16777216;           # Maximum socket send buffer size, determin the amount of data that can be buffered in memory for network operations
    "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl" = 30;      # TCP keepalive interval between probes, TCP keepalive probes, which are used to detect if a connection is still alive.
    "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes" = 5;      # TCP keepalive probes, TCP keepalive probes, which are used to detect if a connection is still alive.
    "net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time" = 300;      # TCP keepalive interval (seconds), TCP keepalive probes, which are used to detect if a connection is still alive.
    "vm.dirty_background_bytes" = 268435456;  # 256 MB in bytes, data that has been modified in memory and needs to be written to disk
    "vm.dirty_bytes" = 1073741824;            # 1 GB in bytes, data that has been modified in memory and needs to be written to disk
    "vm.min_free_kbytes" = 65536;             # Minimum free memory for safety (in KB), can help prevent memory exhaustion situations
    "vm.swappiness" = 1;                      # how aggressively the kernel swaps data from RAM to disk. Lower values prioritize keeping data in RAM,
    "vm.vfs_cache_pressure" = 50;             # Adjust vfs_cache_pressure (0-1000), how the kernel reclaims memory used for caching filesystem objects
  };

## Syncing User Home Folder to a Specified Destination

One of the key scripts I've developed is a custom synchronization script. This script allows me to effortlessly sync my user home folder to a specified destination. By running this script, I can ensure that all my important files and configurations are backed up and accessible from any location. This is particularly helpful when I switch machines or need to restore my settings after a fresh installation.

## Assisting with Mounting, Unmounting, and Suspending

To streamline my workflow, I've also developed a set of personal scripts that assist me with mounting, unmounting, and suspending operations. These scripts automate common tasks, saving me time and effort in managing external drives or suspending my system when I step away. By executing these scripts, I can perform these operations with just a single command, making my workflow more efficient.


## Calling Common NixOS Commands with a Custom Script

To further simplify my interactions with NixOS, I've developed a custom script that encapsulates the most frequently used commands. With this script, I can quickly execute common tasks such as updating the system, installing packages, or configuring services. This saves me the hassle of remembering or typing out lengthy commands each time I need to perform these operations.

# *`How to section`*
#
# Clone NixOS Configuration Repository and Apply Permissions

*Open Dolphin and go to your:*
```
  - home directory
  - press F4 
```
*Advanced users:*
If your confident with the use of the termnal, you can simply copy and paste the following and hit return. Or if you want to learn
and get a feel for some manaul steps, skip this and go to *Step 1*:

```bash
# Tolga Erok
# 14/7/2023
# Post Nixos setup!
# ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

cd $HOME
nix-env -iA nixos.git
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos.git
cd nixos
sudo rsync -av --exclude='.git' ./* /etc/nixos
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn) /etc/nixos
sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/nixos
sudo cp /etc/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.bak
kate /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1
```
## Step 1: 
*Install basic git, download my NixOS.zip repository, unzip, open nixos-main folder*

Step 1: Install git
```nix
nix-env -iA nixos.git
```
Step 2: Clone my repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tolgaerok/nixos.git
```
Step 3: Unzip the downloaded file
```bash
  cd nixos
```
## Step 2: 
*Copy the contents of the cloned "nixos" folder to /etc/nixos*
*Note: This will exclude the hidden .git folder*
```bash
sudo rsync -av --exclude='.git' ./* /etc/nixos
```
## Step 3: 
*Set appropriate ownership and permissions*

Step 1:
```bash
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(id -gn) /etc/nixos
```
Step 2:
```bash
sudo chmod -R 777 /etc/nixos
```
## Backup your original configuration.nix file
```bash
sudo cp /etc/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.bak
```
## Step 4: 
**If you're using the command line or terminal, you can open the `configuration.nix` file using a text editor called `nano`. Here's how:**

  - **Open a terminal on your NixOS system.**

  - **To open the `configuration.nix` file using the `nano` text editor, type the following command:**

   ```bash
   nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
   ```

  - **This will open the `configuration.nix` file in the `nano` editor, allowing you to make changes. Navigate to the appropriate location and add or modify the lines as needed.**

  - **After making your changes, press `Ctrl` + `O` to save the changes, then press `Enter`. To exit `nano`, press `Ctrl` + `X`.**

If you prefer to use the graphical text editor `Kate`, you can follow these steps:

  - **Open a terminal on your NixOS system.**

  - **To open the `configuration.nix` file using `Kate`, type the following command:**

   ```bash
   kate /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
   ```

  - **This will open the `configuration.nix` file in the `Kate` editor. You can navigate to the desired location and make changes directly in the graphical interface.**
    
### Locate the imports section in the file. It will look like this: ###

*This is the default layout on new install*
 ```nix
  imports =
  [ # Include the results of the hardware scan.
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
  ];
```
### Add the desired lines just before the closing square bracket ]. Make sure to maintain the indentation. Here's how it should look after adding the lines: ###
```nix
imports = [ 
   # ./hardware/gpu/intel/intel-laptop                     # INTEL GPU with (Open-GL), tlp and auto-cpufreq
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-stable/nvidia-stable.nix  # NVIDIA stable for GT-710--
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-opengl/nvidia-opengl.nix  # NVIDIA with hardware acceleration (Open-GL) for GT-1030++
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ./nix
    ./packages
    ./programs
    ./services
    ./system
  ];

# Including this
nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [ "openssl-1.1.1v" ];

```

  - **After making your changes, save the file using the appropriate option in the `Kate` menu.**

Keep in mind that `nano` is a terminal-based text editor, while `Kate` is a graphical text editor. You can choose the one that you're more comfortable with. Additionally, when using graphical editors like `Kate`, be sure to launch them with `sudo` to have the necessary permissions to edit system files.

# Configuring GPU Drivers in NixOS

If you're looking to configure GPU drivers on your NixOS system, follow these steps to choose the appropriate driver based on your hardware:

1. **Open `configuration.nix` File:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to your NixOS configuration directory. Use either of the following methods to open the `configuration.nix` file:

   - **Using nano:**
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     ```
   - **Using Kate Text Editor:**
     ```bash
     kate /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     ```

2. **Locate GPU Driver Options:**

   After successfully adding the required lines from **Step 4**, in the `configuration.nix` file, scroll down until you find the `imports = [` section. This section is usually located near the beginning of the file and should looks like this now:
   
```nix
imports = [ 
   # ./hardware/gpu/intel/intel-laptop                      # INTEL GPU with (Open-GL), tlp and auto-cpufreq
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-stable/nvidia-stable.nix  # NVIDIA stable for GT-710--
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-opengl/nvidia-opengl.nix  # NVIDIA with hardware acceleration (Open-GL) for GT-1030++
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ./nix
    ./packages
    ./programs
    ./services
    ./system
  ];

# Including this
nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [ "openssl-1.1.1v" ];
```

   The top few lines in the `imports = [ ... ]` line, you will find the GPU driver options section. It will look like this:
   
   ```nix
   # ./hardware/gpu/intel/intel-laptop                      # INTEL GPU with (Open-GL), tlp and auto-cpufreq
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-stable/nvidia-stable.nix  # NVIDIA stable for GT-710--
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-opengl/nvidia-opengl.nix  # NVIDIA with hardware acceleration (Open-GL) for GT-1030++
   ```

3. **Choose Your GPU Driver:**

   Depending on your hardware, you can choose the appropriate GPU driver option. Each option is followed by a brief description of its use case. Comment out (add `#` at the beginning of the line) the lines for GPU drivers you don't need. For   example, if you have an Intel GPU, comment out the lines related to NVIDIA drivers.
   
    *For example, if you have an Intel GPU and want to use the Intel driver, it should look like:*
```nix
   imports = [ 
   ./hardware/gpu/intel/intel-laptop                      # INTEL GPU with (Open-GL), tlp and auto-cpufreq
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-stable/nvidia-stable.nix  # NVIDIA stable for GT-710--
   # ./hardware/gpu/nvidia/nvidia-opengl/nvidia-opengl.nix  # NVIDIA with hardware acceleration (Open-GL) for GT-1030++
    ./hardware-configuration.nix
    ./nix
    ./packages
    ./programs
    ./services
    ./system
  ];

# Including this
nixpkgs.config.permittedInsecurePackages = [ "openssl-1.1.1v" ];
```

5. **Save and Apply Changes:**

   After making your choice, save the changes to the `configuration.nix` file. If you used *nano*, press `Ctrl + O` to write the changes and then `Ctrl + X` to exit. If you used *Kate*, simply close the editor.
   
By following these steps, you can easily configure GPU drivers on your NixOS system according to your hardware setup. Remember to regularly check for updates and changes in the driver options based on your hardware requirements.

# Elevating Your NixOS Experience: Enhancing User Profile Permissions

Welcome to the realm of NixOS customization! As you navigate the intricacies of your NixOS system, you might find the need to empower your user profile with enhanced permissions, allowing you to seamlessly interact with various components of the platform. By following these steps, you'll empower your user-profile with an enriched profile that includes extended permissions and group memberships. 

*Here's how you can achieve just that:*

1. **Open `configuration.nix` File:**

   Open a terminal and navigate to your NixOS configuration directory. Use either of the following methods to open the `configuration.nix` file:

   - **Using nano:**
     ```bash
     sudo nano /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     ```
   - **Using Kate Text Editor:**
     ```bash
     kate /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
     ```

2. **Locate Your User Profile Section**

Within the `configuration.nix` file, you'll discover a section dedicated to your user profile. This portion, often resembling the following structure, encapsulates your user-specific settings:

```nix
users.users.username = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  description = "User's Full Name";
  extraGroups = [ "wheel" "networkmanager" ];
};
```

3. **Enhance Your Profile's Capabilities**

It's here that the magic unfolds. After the `description` line in your user profile section, you'll introduce a set of configurations designed to amplify your permissions and enrich your interactions within NixOS. 
Simply copy & paste where the indicators are:

```nix
users.users.username = {
  isNormalUser = true;
  description = "User's Full Name";

  homeMode = "0755";        # <-----  Copy from here
  uid = 1000;  # Replace with your specific UID
  extraGroups = [
    "adbusers"
    "audio"
    "corectrl"
    "disk"
    "input"
    "lp"
    "mongodb"
    "mysql"
    "network"
    "networkmanager"
    "postgres"
    "power"
    "scanner"
    "sound"
    "systemd-journal"
    "users"
    "video"
    "wheel"      
  ];
  packages = [ pkgs.home-manager ];   # <-----  To here

};

```

These lines of code not only bestow you with enhanced permissions, but they also extend your access to specific groups that define various aspects of NixOS functionality. With the inclusion of `pkgs.home-manager`, your configuration takes a step towards seamless management of your user settings.

**System Enhancements**

To effortlessly amplify your NixOS system, consider integrating this snippet below the audio configuration. It’s a quick process that will bring a host of automatic upgrades and system enhancements into play:

*Note: Do not over write or leave out `system.stateVersion = "23.05";`*

```nix
# --------------------------------------------------------------------
# Automated System Enhancements
# --------------------------------------------------------------------

# Enable automatic system upgrades and reboots if necessary
system.autoUpgrade.enable = true;
# system.autoUpgrade.allowReboot = true;
system.copySystemConfiguration = true;
systemd.extraConfig = "DefaultTimeoutStopSec=10s";
```

This simple snippet wields great power. It introduces automatic system upgrades and, if required, seamless reboots. By enabling `system.autoUpgrade`, you let your NixOS stay up to date effortlessly. With `system.copySystemConfiguration`, system enhancements become a part of your experience. The `systemd.extraConfig` adds a touch of efficiency to stop sequences.

1. **Swift Copy-Paste**

Integrating the above snippet is as swift as its enhancements. Just copy the snippet beneath your audio configuration in your `configuration.nix` file.

#
<a name="rebuild"></a>
# nixos-rebuild switch

After adding all the configurations above, save the `configuration.nix` file. To apply the changes, execute the following command in your terminal:

   ```nix
   export NIXPKGS_ALLOW_INSECURE=1
   sudo nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade
   ```

This command will update your system with the new GPU driver, audio, system and user profile configurations. If this is your first rebuild from this repository, the required files and services will now start to install.

*If this is your first rebuild along with the GPU driver selection, the overall process WILL take some time, so, grab a cuppa and enjoy the ride!*
