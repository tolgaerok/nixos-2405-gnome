# *hardware-configuration.nix*

The provided script appears to be a configuration file for the NixOS operating system. Here is a brief summary of its contents:

1. The `imports` field includes the path to a Nix module called "not-detected.nix" from the "installer/scan" directory. This module is imported and used in the configuration.
2. The `boot.initrd.availableKernelModules` field lists various kernel modules that should be available in the initial RAM disk. These modules are related to USB, storage, and other device drivers.
3. The `boot.initrd.kernelModules` field is an empty list, indicating that no additional kernel modules are included in the initial RAM disk.
4. The `boot.kernelModules` field contains a single entry, "kvm-intel", specifying that the KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) module for Intel processors should be loaded.
5. The `boot.extraModulePackages` field is an empty list, meaning no additional kernel module packages are installed.
6. The `boot.kernelParams` field contains a single kernel parameter, "mitigations=off", which disables certain security mitigations.
7. The `fileSystems` field defines two file systems. The first one ("/") is an ext4 file system mounted on the device with the UUID "e465813a-xxxxxx". It includes options for improving performance on SSDs.
8. The second file system ("/mnt/nixos_share") is a CIFS file system mounted from a remote server using the "//192.168.0.20/LinuxData/HOME/PROFILES/NIXOS-23-05/TOLGA/" path. It specifies options for automounting and provides credentials for accessing the share.
9.   This configuration includes the following automount and options:

     - `automount_opts`: Specifies options for automounting, including systemd-related options like idle timeout, device timeout, mount timeout, and network target requirement.
     - `uid:` The user ID used for accessing the mounted filesystem.
     - `gid:` The group ID used for accessing the mounted filesystem.
     - `vers:` The SMB protocol version used for the CIFS filesystem.
     - `cache_opts:` Specifies caching options for the mounted filesystem.

      *Note:* 
     > Some specific values, such as the device paths and user/group IDs, need to be customized according to your system setup.

10. The `swapDevices` field is an empty list, indicating that no swap devices are configured.
11. The `networking.useDHCP` field is set to `true`, enabling DHCP for network configuration. The `networking.interfaces.wlp3s0.useDHCP` field specifically enables DHCP for the wireless interface with the name "wlp3s0".
12. The `nixpkgs.hostPlatform` field specifies the host platform as "x86_64-linux".
13. The `hardware.cpu.intel.updateMicrocode` field is set based on the value of `config.hardware.enableRedistributableFirmware`. If the latter is `true`, it enables the update of Intel microcode.

# *Summary*
*Overall, this script configures various aspects of the NixOS operating system, including kernel modules, file systems, networking, and CPU microcode updates.*
