    # Note: Load Module
    # in terminal: sudo modprobe zram num_devices=4

    # check the status of Zram and whether the module is loaded by running the following command:   
    #   sudo lsblk
    #   lsmod | grep zram
    #
    # I have 28GB so 35% of 28GB is around 9.6GB of zram disk / swap created
    #
    # Pros and Cons:
    # - Pros:
    #   - Memory Efficiency: Zram can help manage memory efficiently, reducing the need for excessive swapping.
    #   - Performance: Zram can improve system responsiveness by minimizing disk-based swapping.
    #
    # - Cons:
    #   - Plenty of Physical RAM: With 28GB of RAM, I have ample memory. Zram's benefits may be minimal.
    #   - CPU Overhead: Zram uses CPU cycles for compression, which may not be justifiable on systems with ample RAM.
